// in SQL databases data stored in tables.
// tables have fields
// SQL based databases allow you to relate different tables.

// Core SQL Databases characteristics:
// 1. Strong data schema - how data should look like.
// 2. Data relations (Tables are connected) We relate different tables: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many

// SQL - Structured Query Language. Query is a command we use to interact with database;
// query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 28;

// NoSQL collections => documents close to JS objects;
// NoSQL Characteristics:
// No SQL does not have strict schema: mixed data in same collection
// No Data Relations (you can relate documents, but you don't have to (and shouldn't do it too much or your queries become slow))

// Horizontal and Vertical scaling.
// Horizontal - add more servers and merge data into one database;
// Vertical - improve existing server;

// Horizontal scaling is very difficult of even impossible for SQL, and vertical scaling is possible
// NoSQL - both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible;
